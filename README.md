# Write Only Text

Distraction free: write only text. Backspace, copy and clear allowed. Will tell start, end and word count for session.

Originally developed at [Write Only Text (codepen.io)](https://codepen.io/mihaibirsan/full/rNWdoJj)

## Features
+ Typing only appends to the end of the string. 
+ There is no editing, with one exception: backspace is permitted.
+ Text is saved to localStorage, for convenience.

Basic UX
+ Confirmation dialog when clearing text.

## TODO
+ Keep a timer.

## Running locally

```sh
npx http-server

NOTE: Useful when developing for mobile!

npx run dev
```
